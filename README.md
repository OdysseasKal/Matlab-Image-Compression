Matlab-Image-Compression:

Compresses an image sized 8x by 8x pixels using the discrete cosine transform on the chromatic layers (and less on the intensity layers) of an image converted in YCbCr format.

In this example, it compresses the "House.png", a file that is 4.17MB to 1.54MB.

This is a program I created after one week of independent-learning of MATLAB.
